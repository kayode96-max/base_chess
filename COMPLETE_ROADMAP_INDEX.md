## ❓ FAQ About This Roadmap

**Q: Do I have to do all 28 commits?**
A: No! Start with Phase 1, it's the most impactful. Then pick what matters for your use case.

**Q: Can I change the order?**
A: Phase 1 should stay in order (foundational). After that, reorder as needed.

**Q: What if I skip a commit?**
A: Each is independent. Pick and choose what adds value for you.

**Q: How do I avoid conflicts?**
A: These all add new files. No conflicts with existing code.

**Q: Can I combine commits?**
A: Sure! Group related commits if you prefer fewer, larger commits. Just keep each one logical.

**Q: What's the minimum viable set?**
A: Commits 1-3 (setup) + 9 (API docs) + 10 (contributing) + 14 (CI) + 28 (deployment) = ~8 hours, huge value.
