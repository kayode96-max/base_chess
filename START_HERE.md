## 🚀 How to Use (3 Options)

### Option A: The Professional Way (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Read strategic overview
Open: HIGH_VALUE_ADDITIONS.md (15 min)

# 2. Execute Phase 1 (foundation)
Open: EXECUTION_ROADMAP_PHASE1.md
Create branch: git checkout -b feat/infrastructure-docs
Follow commits 1-10 in order
Test and commit locally

# 3. Execute Phase 2 (infrastructure)
Open: EXECUTION_ROADMAP_PHASE2.md
Follow commits 11-17 in order
Test and commit locally

# 4. Execute Phase 3 (quality)
Open: EXECUTION_ROADMAP_PHASE3_AND_MASTER.md
Follow commits 18-28 in order
Review master checklist

# 5. Final validation
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
npm test

# 6. Push and create PR
git push origin feat/infrastructure-docs
Create PR on GitHub
```

**Time:** ~13-16 hours  
**Result:** 28 commits, comprehensive infrastructure

---

### Option B: The Quick Path (Minimum Viable)
```bash
# Do Phase 1 only (10 commits)
# Do Phase 2 commits 14-15 (CI/CD)
# Do Phase 3 commits 21, 28 (Key docs)

Total: ~12 commits, ~8 hours
Still shows: Professional quality + CI/CD + docs
```

---

### Option C: The Custom Path
```bash
# Pick what matters to YOU:

If you care most about:
- Documentation → Do Phase 3 commits
- Testing → Do Phase 2 commits
- Reliability → Do Phase 1 commits
- Speed → Do commits 1-3, 9-10, 14-15, 28

Mix and match based on your priorities!
